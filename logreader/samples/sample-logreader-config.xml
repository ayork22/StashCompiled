  This is a sample config file for the EPA LogReader framework, a CA Wily Field Pack
  to be used in conjunction with the Introscope EPAgent.

  For questions or enhancement requests contact Jeff Morris (jeff.morris@ca.com)

  A LogReader config file can contain one or more <LogReader> elements that
  define the basic characteristics LogReader thread within the framework

  The attributes of the LogReader tags are as follows:

     type - The LogReader type.  This can be one of the pre-defined types or a
            custom type. (required)
            
       The Predefined types are: 

       "ColumnData" - a basic log reader for logs that contain columnar data where
           each column in the log file represents a separate metric.  An example
           of this type would be the output from the vmstat command (See sample below)

       "SimpleMatchCount" - a basic log reader for logs that contain rows of data 
           where you want to match and count the number of rows that contain certain
           specific text strings.  Multiple text strings and associated metrics
           can be defined.  An example of this would be an error log file where 
           you wanted to count the number of occurrences of "java.io.IOException"
           and generate a metric called "IOException: Errors Per Interval"
           to keep track of this (See sample below)

	   "RegexMatchCount" - this is a more advanced version of the SimpleMatchCount
           where the lines are matched using a regex pattern instead of a simple
           string match and also the metric names can be dynamically generated
           by using parts of the regex pattern in the metric name.  The example
           below uses a common use case of this where the error code in the line
           can be variable and the LogReader can automatically generate different
           metrics separating by error code

       "HashColumn" - this is a special mixed case of a row-based and column-based
           log file where each row essentially contains name value pairs or "hashes".
           One column contains strings representing metric names and a separate column
           contains values.

       "custom" - This allows for custom log readers.  The log reader is extensible
           to the point that those familiar with Java may supply extension classes
           that extend the ALogReader abstract class and implement the ILineProcessor
           interface to decide how to parse individual lines from the log file
           (Documented seperately)

   sourceFile - This attribute specifies the path to the log file to process.  If the
       value of sourceFile is "command" this indicates to use the command attribute
       to run a shell command and use the output as the source for the logreader
       (i.e. vmstat) (required)

   command - If sourceFile="command", this attribute specifies the shell command to 
       execute (optional)

   metricNode - The metric node for data coming from this log reader (optional).  
       The name of this node is appended to the 'topMetricNode' as defined in the 
       LogReaderConfig XML element

   class - This attribute is used when type="custom" to specify the classname
       of the class to use for this LogReader.  This class must be loadable
       using reflection and extend the ALogReader abstract class.

  <ReaderParms>
    Each LogReader can have multiple parameters speified as "ReaderParm" elements
    Some are applicable to all LogReaders and some are specific based on the LogReader
    type. 

    startAtTop - Indicates whether to start processing at the top of the log file.  By
        default if this parameter is not specified the log reader initially reads
        to the end of the log file and waits for more rows to be added, processing them
        as they arrive.  This parameter if specified and equal to "true" is designed
        for testing and demo purposes only (Default = false)

    lineDelay - This parameter is also designed for testing/demo purposes.  It represents
        an integer number of seconds to pause between reading/processing each line
        in the log file.  This is so on a demo or testing the log reader doesn't 
        consume all of the data immediately.  (Default = 0)

    For a ColumnData log reader, each row is represented by one or more "column groups"
    represented by the <ColumnGroup> XML attribute.  This attribute takes one parameter,
    "metricNode" which is the metric node under which all metrics in this column group
    will appear in the Investigator.  This construct allows categorization of different
    data into groups 

    Each <ColumnData> element defines one column in the log file.  Attributes are:

       column - The column number.  First column is column 1

       type - The metric type for this column.  Possible values are the same as for 
              any EPAgent

       metric - The metric name for this column

    <!--------------------
    A SimpleMachCount LogReader must have one <MatchList> element with one
    or more <MatchItem> child elements

    The are two attributes for each <MatchItem> element

      pattern - The string to match.  This is an exact match against rows in 
                the log file.  Each row that matches the pattern will add 1 
                to the count

      metric - The metric name to generate corresponding to the pattern
               string.  Each metric is automatically of type PerIntervalCounter

    ---------------->

	<MatchList>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 0" metric="Error 0 - Debug Msg"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 19119" metric="Error 19119 - Tokenizer Failure"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 15245" metric="Error 15245 - Missing PDF"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 20611" metric="Error 20611 - Socket Error"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 24803" metric="Error 24803 - XML Parse Error"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 24804" metric="Error 24804 - Source Name Mismatch"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 15209" metric="Error 15209"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 29518" metric="Error 29518"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 29511" metric="Error 29511"/>
	  <MatchItem pattern="ErrNo: 4" metric="Error 4"/>
	</MatchList>
  </LogReader>

  <!-- ======================================================== -->
  <!-- RegexMatchCount LogReader                                -->
  <!-- ======================================================== -->

  <LogReader type="RegexMatchCount" sourceFile="master_event.log"  metricNode="Errors">

    <!-- There are no special ReaderParms for the SimpleMatchCount LogReader
         startAtTop and lineDelay are supported
    -->

    <!----------------------------
    RegexMatchCount log reader also has one <MatchList> element with one or more
    <MatchItem> children.  The difference is the syntax of the pattern and metric
    attributes is a little more complex

    pattern - This is the pattern to match and instead of being a simple match 
              supports regular expressions.  Any row matching the regular expression
              is counted

    metric - The metric name.  In general this is simple text but it supports one special 
             construct.  Each occurence of {n} in the metric name is replaced with
             the value of "capturing group" n from the pattern (somewhat explained below
             more detail in standard regular expression literature).  This allows
             the metric name to be dynamic based on data from the matched string from 
             the log file

    valueGrp - This optional attribute, if specified, takes the value of the metric
               from the pattern string using a capturing group instead of just counting
               a match as 1.  This allows you to match rows with variable data
    ------------------------------>

	<MatchList>
      <!---------------
      The example below works like this:

      In the pattern attribute, "\d" in regex means “match any digit”. 
      The “+” sign means match one or more occurrences.

      So, “\d+” means match a string of “one or more occurrences of a digit”.  
      Therefore it will match “1”, “12”, “234”, “527”, etc.

      The parentheses are a grouping symbol so that whatever is matched between the parentheses,
      in this case the string of digits, becomes the group.

      In the metric name {1} is replaced by "capturing group 1" which is whatever string is
      matched between the first set of parentheses in the matched pattern string

      So, for example if the log file line of text in a file like the following

      Yada yada yada | ErrNo: 456 | more yada yada

      this string matches the pattern, and (\d+) matches 456, so it counts as 1 

      and creates the metric “Error 456 Per Interval count”
      ------------->

	  <MatchItem pattern=".*\| ErrNo: (\d+) \|.*" metric="Error {1} Per Interval Count"/>

      <!----------------
      This example uses the "valueGrp" attribute

      It is designed to match rows in the log file similar to below

      "Number of Active Sessions: 222"

      In this case "Number of Active Sessions" occurs between the parentheses in the pattern
      The metric specifier is simply {1} meaning the metric name becomes "Number of Active
      Sessions"  

      Then the second capturing group is (\d+) which represents variable numeric data,
      in this case 222

      So the metric value of 222 would be reported for the metric "Number of Active Sessions"
      ----------------->

	  <MatchItem pattern=".*(Number of Active Sessions): (\d+).*" metric="{1}" valueGrp="2"/>

	</MatchList>
  </LogReader>
